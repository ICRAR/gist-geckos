#              We remind the user to also cite the papers of the underlying analysis techniques and models, if these are
#              used in the analysis. These are in particular: 
#               * Voronoi-binning method: 
#                   ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/?#abs/2003MNRAS.342..345C
#               * Penalized Pixel-Fitting (pPXF) method: 
#                   ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/?#abs/2004PASP..116..138C
#                   ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/?#abs/2017MNRAS.466..798C
#               * pyGandALF routine: 
#                   ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/?#abs/2006MNRAS.366.1151S
#                   ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006MNRAS.369..529F

#                   ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2018MNRAS.475.3700M
#               * MILES models:

# 
#              Although we provide this pipeline as a convenient, all-in-one framework for the analysis of IFS data, it
#              is of fundamental importance that the user understands exactly how the involved analysis methods work.
#              We warn that the improper use of any of these analysis methods, whether executed within the framework of
#              the GIST pipeline or not, will likely result in spurious or erroneous results and their proper use is
#              solely the responsibility of the user.  Likewise, the user should be fully aware of the properties of the
#              input data before intending to derive high-level data products. Therefore, this pipeline should not be
#              simply adopted as a black-box. To this extend, we urge any user to get familiar with both the input data
#              and analysis methods, as well as their implementation in this pipeline.
#
#              We thank Harald Kuntschner and Alexandre Vazdekis for permission to distribute the Python version of the
#              line strength measurement routine and the MILES model library with this software package. The authors
#              also thank Michele Cappellari for permission to implement a Python translation of his log-unbinning
#              routine.
