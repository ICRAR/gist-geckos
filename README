General Remarks
---------------

If you use this code for any publication, please cite the paper Bittner et al. 2019 (A&A, 628, A117;
https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190604746B) and mention its webpage
(https://abittner.gitlab.io/thegistpipeline) in a footnote. 

We remind the user to also cite the papers of the underlying analysis techniques and models, if these are used in the
analysis. Using the default GIST implementation, these are in particular: 
 * Voronoi-binning method:

 * Penalized Pixel-Fitting (pPXF) method: 
     - https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/?#abs/2004PASP..116..138C
     - https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/?#abs/2017MNRAS.466..798C
 * pyGandALF routine:

     - https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006MNRAS.369..529F

 * LS-Measurements routines:

     - https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2018MNRAS.475.3700M
 * MILES models: 
     - https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2010MNRAS.404.1639V

Although we provide this pipeline as a convenient, all-in-one framework for the analysis of IFS data, it is of
fundamental importance that the user understands exactly how the involved analysis methods work.  We warn that the
improper use of any of these analysis methods, whether executed within the framework of the GIST pipeline or not, will
likely result in spurious or erroneous results and their proper use is solely the responsibility of the user.  Likewise,
the user should be fully aware of the properties of the input data before intending to derive high-level data products.
Therefore, this pipeline should not be simply adopted as a black-box. To this extend, we urge any user to get familiar
with both the input data and analysis methods, as well as their implementation in this pipeline.

We thank Harald Kuntschner and Alexandre Vazdekis for permission to distribute the Python version of the line strength
measurement routine and the MILES model library with this software package. The authors also thank Michele Cappellari
for permission to implement a Python translation of his log-unbinning routine.
